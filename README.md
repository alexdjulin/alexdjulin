Take a look at the projects I am mostly proud of:

## Chatbots
1. **[AI Librarian](https://github.com/alexdjulin/ik-multimodal-ai-librarian)**  - _Meet Alice, your personal AI Librarian._  
Alice is a robust conversational chatbot created to answer user queries about books and litterature in general, search a vector database, fetch book information from Wikipedia, and retrieve transcripts of book reviews from YouTube. But beware, she tends to talk a lot if you mention 19th century gothic romanticism so you better plan an full afternoon session with her ;)

2. **[Movie Advisor](https://github.com/alexdjulin/movie-advisor)** -  _Movie night? Here are some ideas!_  
   Chat with a virtual AI chatbot and get movie recommendations based on your watch history and preferences. This project implements a RAG system based on Langchain, Xata Postgresql and The Move DB.
   
3. **[Virtual AI Avatar](https://github.com/alexdjulin/virtual-ai-avatar)** -  _Can't beat a chat with yourself._  
   A high-realistic virtual clone of my face and voice, driven by GPT3 and rendered in the Unreal Engine, showing advanced lipsync and facial animation.
   
## Machine Learning Models
1. **[CNN Image Classifier](https://github.com/alexdjulin/ik-image-classification-with-cnn)**  -  _Small dataset, no problem!_  
   A CNN classifier based on fine-tuned ResNet50 scoring 95% validation accuracy on CIFAR10.
   
2. **[Robo Reviews](https://github.com/alexdjulin/ik-robo-reviews-generator)**  -  _Combine models and automate tasks._  
   A genuine implementation of 3 ML models from HuggingFace: a clusterer, a sentiment analyser and a summarizer (based on fine-tuned Mistral) to automate product descriptions based on a dataset of reviews.

3. [Intent Classifier for Customer Service](https://github.com/alexdjulin/openai-intent-classifier)  -  _Assist your customers, fast and efficiently_  
   This project implements a zero- or few-shot intent classifier based on a fine-tuned GPT3 model, that can be used to provide inferencing service via an HTTP Service.

4. [Spotify Playlist Generator](https://github.com/alexdjulin/spotify-playlist-generator)  -  _Out of ideas? Create playlists from a prompt_  
   This project implements a command-line Spotify playlist generator, based on an input prompt.

## Computer Vision
1. **[Bike Helmet Detection](https://github.com/alexdjulin/BikeHelmetDetection)**  -  _Be safe out there, wear a helmet!_  
   A urban safety computer vision project. I fine-tuned YoloV8 to detect cyclists wearing helmets or not to increase awareness and reduce casualties.

2. **[Rock Paper Scissors](https://github.com/alexdjulin/RockPaperScissorsCNN)**  -  _Never lose again!_  
   I created my own dataset, trained a CNN from scratch and made a computer vision app to recognize these 3 hand gestures in real-time. You can't play though, I know, how disapointing!
